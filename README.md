## Hello, I am Ramsha! 👋
🎓 **Senior at Smith College majoring in Computer Science and Statistical and Data Sciences.** 

🔍 **Passionate about AI, software engineering, and making an impact through technology**

I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world challenges, whether it’s developing AI-driven solutions or contributing to research like my geolocation project, which was featured at the TMA Conference in Germany. These experiences have only deepened my commitment to leveraging tech for meaningful impact.

Currently, I’m an AI Studio Fellow at Michelin Mobility Intelligence, working on a machine learning project aimed at reducing road crashes and fatalities. My internships at Microsoft sharpened my ability to collaborate effectively across teams and deliver impactful projects. 

I love connecting with others who share my passion for creating change through technology. Have an opportunity or just want to chat about tech for good? Let’s connect—I’d love to hear from you! 🚀
